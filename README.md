1 Introduction

Brake lining is a layer of hard material attached to a brake shoe or brake pad to increase friction against the drum or disc. It is a heat resistant padding, often of asbestos, attached to a brake shoe to produce friction.

It is a restraint provided when the brake linings are moved hydraulically against the brake drum to retard the wheel’s rotation. In simple words it is a protective covering that protects an inside surface.

2 Defects

Flaws in brake liners are produced in manufacturing(Curing and Post Curing stages). During these processes there may be chance of irregular distribution of pressure and temperature that may lead to defect in brake liner. Examples of ﬂaws found in brake liners are: Delaminations; cracks; disbonds; voids; Impact or Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID); porosity; inclusions; erosion; core splices; core disbonds; core crushing; environmental ingress; incorrect cure and incorrect volume fraction

3 Objective 

The objective behind this research project was to ﬁnd a simple and reliable method for detecting damage in brake lining.

4 Methodology

The experimental process developed for this research consisted of three main stages. The ﬁrst stage involved tapping the brake liner with an hammer and recording the acoustic sound signals captured by a microphone. The second stage consisted of taking the time based tap signals and reduce noise from it. Since the tapping is done in shop ﬂoor a lot of noise due to machines also records along with the tapping signal. The third stage is to employ signal processing technique on the reﬁned signal. The objective of the signal processing stage is to identify characteristic patterns of each of the acoustic signals which describes the integrity of the structure. From this stage we were able to distinguish between good and brake liner by analyzing impact acoustic frequency spectrum.
