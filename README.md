1 Introduction

Brake lining is a layer of hard material attached to a brake shoe or brake pad to increase friction against the drum or disc. It is a heat resistant padding, often of asbestos, attached to a brake shoe to produce friction.

It is a restraint provided when the brake linings are moved hydraulically against the brake drum to retard the wheel’s rotation. In simple words it is a protective covering that protects an inside surface.

2 Defects

Flaws in brake liners are produced in manufacturing(Curing and Post Curing stages). During these processes there may be chance of irregular distribution of pressure and temperature that may lead to defect in brake liner. Examples of ﬂaws found in brake liners are: Delaminations; cracks; disbonds; voids; Impact or Barely Visible Impact Damage (BVID); porosity; inclusions; erosion; core splices; core disbonds; core crushing; environmental ingress; incorrect cure and incorrect volume fraction

3 Objective 

The objective behind this research project was to ﬁnd a simple and reliable method for detecting damage in brake lining.
