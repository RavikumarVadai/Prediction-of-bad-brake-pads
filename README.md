1 Introduction

Brake lining is a layer of hard material attached to a brake shoe or brake pad to increase friction against the drum or disc. It is a heat resistant padding, often of asbestos, attached to a brake shoe to produce friction.

It is a restraint provided when the brake linings are moved hydraulically against the brake drum to retard the wheelâ€™s rotation. In simple words it is a protective covering that protects an inside surface.
